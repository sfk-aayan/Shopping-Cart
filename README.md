# Shopping-Cart
A Shopping Cart created for my CSE 4636 course using Java Servlets, Java Beans, JSP, CSS and JavaScript following the MVC architecture.

To run this project, a server is required. Example: `Apache Tomcat`

`JDBC connectors` are also needed to establish a connection with a database. I have included a jar file in the lib folder for that purpose.
The images needed for the project have also been included in the images folder.

After setting up the required dependencies, run the project and enjoy!
